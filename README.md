## Notes

All required features are met. 

1. I provide a text input and buttons as two different ways for users to create new gamers.
2. Users can update gamers, which will be reflected in the updated summary page.
3. Due to ambiguous requirements list, my interpretation of Details Page is implemented in combination with the Edit Gamer feature. Each gamer has a uniquely linked direct page that provides details about its attributes before giving an option for users to edit the attributes or return to the summary.
4. Users can delete gamers, which will be reflected in the updated summary page.
